# NYC_school_data_analysis

## Tools
* SQL
* Jupter Notebook

In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from New York City's public school system.
I analyzed how performance varies by borough, identified how many schools fail to report information, and found the top ten performing schools across the city.

Through the analysis it was determined that Staten Island has the schools with the highest average test scores followed by Queens and Manhattan. The information can be utilzed by district leaders to determine what resources and supports could be used in schools in The Bronx and Brooklyn to increase SAT scores amoungst its student population.
