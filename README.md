# NYC_school_data_analysis

## Tools
* SQL
* Jupter Notebook

In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.
I analyzed at how performance varies by borough, identify how many schools fail to report information, and find the top ten performing schools across the city.
